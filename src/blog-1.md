# The Significance of Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

TypeScript is popular for its type safety and flexibility, making it a go-to language for JavaScript developers. Two powerful features it offers are **union** and **intersection types**. These types help you write flexible, readable, and error-resistant code. In this post, we'll explore what union and intersection types are, why they're useful, and how to apply them effectively.

## 1. What Are Union Types?

Union types allow a variable to hold more than one type. This feature is useful when you want a variable to accept multiple types, giving your code flexibility to handle different data formats safely.

### Example of Union Types:

```typescript
function formatInput(input: string | number): string {
  return `Formatted value: ${input}`;
}
```

In this example, the `input` parameter is a **union type** (`string | number`), so `formatInput` can handle both strings and numbers without causing type errors.

### How It Helps:

Union types are particularly useful when dealing with APIs that might return various data types or when you need functions that handle multiple formats. With union types, you can create adaptable code without duplicating functions.

## 2. What Are Intersection Types?

Intersection types combine multiple types into one, requiring an object to satisfy all combined types. This is helpful when you want an object to meet multiple sets of requirements.

### Example of Intersection Types:

```typescript
interface NameInfo {
  name: string;
}

interface ContactInfo {
  email: string;
  phone: string;
}

type Profile = NameInfo & ContactInfo;

const user: Profile = {
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  phone: "123-456-7890",
};
```

Here, `Profile` is an **intersection type** that combines `NameInfo` and `ContactInfo`. The `user` object must have all properties defined in both interfaces (`name`, `email`, and `phone`).

### How It Helps:

Intersection types are valuable when working with complex data structures, allowing you to combine smaller, reusable types into a new type that meets the exact requirements of your model. This helps maintain organized, non-redundant code.

## 3. Real-World Scenarios for Union and Intersection Types

### Example Scenario for Union Types:

A function that processes user input, which could be either text or a boolean value, is an ideal use case for union types.

```typescript
function handleUserInput(input: string | boolean): string {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    return `User said: ${input}`;
  } else {
    return input ? "User agreed" : "User disagreed";
  }
}

console.log(handleUserInput("Hello")); // "User said: Hello"
console.log(handleUserInput(true)); // "User agreed"
```

### Example Scenario for Intersection Types:

If you're building a system where each user has general info but premium users have additional privileges, intersection types provide an efficient solution.

```typescript
interface UserInfo {
  id: number;
  name: string;
}

interface PremiumFeatures {
  premiumAccount: boolean;
  bonusPoints: number;
}

type PremiumUser = UserInfo & PremiumFeatures;

const premiumUser: PremiumUser = {
  id: 1,
  name: "Alice",
  premiumAccount: true,
  bonusPoints: 100,
};
```

With this setup, the `PremiumUser` type includes both `UserInfo` and `PremiumFeatures` properties, keeping your code clean and maintainable.

## 4. Key Takeaways

- **Union types** (`type A | B`) allow variables to hold multiple types, useful for flexible inputs.
- **Intersection types** (`type A & B`) combine multiple types, ideal for merging properties of several types.

Union and intersection types are essential in TypeScript for enhancing type safety and maintaining clean, flexible code. By using these types thoughtfully, you can build robust applications that handle diverse data scenarios while keeping your code organized.
